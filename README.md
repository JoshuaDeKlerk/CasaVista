## How To Install

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaDeKlerk/CasaVista.git
```

### Step 2: Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install XAMPP:**
   - Download and install XAMPP from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
   - Ensure that both Apache and MySQL modules are running in the XAMPP Control Panel.

2. **Move Project Files:**
   - Navigate to your XAMPP installation directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on macOS).
   - Copy the entire project folder to the `htdocs` directory. 
   - Rename the project folder to `CasaVista`

3. **Create the database**
- Open your browser and go to [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
- In phpMyAdmin, click on the "New" button in the sidebar to create a new database.
- Name your database `casavista` and click "Create."

4. **Import the Database Structure**

- With the `casavista` database selected, click on the "Import" tab.
- Click the "Choose File" button and navigate to the `db` folder within your project directory.
- Select the `casavista.sql` file and click "Go" to import the database structure and initial data.

### Step 3: Running the Project

1. **Configure Database Connection:**
- In the `server.php` file located in the root of your project directory, update the database connection settings:
```php
    $hostname = "localhost";
    $dbUser = "root";
    $dbPassword = "";
    $dbName = "casavista";
```

2. **Access the Website:**
-   Open your browser and go to http://localhost/CasaVista.

### Step 4: Additional Notes

## The Idea

The idea was to create a rental website where users can post houses or apartments to sell. It should be easy for users to find their dream home and it should be a website where agents can easily list homes for sale. The site should have secure security to make sure nobody lists a property that should not be listed.

## Development Process

### Highlights
* Highlights of the website is the simplistic UI and the functionality that gives the user a pleasant user experience.
* The website is easy to understand and navigate.

### Challenges
* Getting all the backend to work and when styling some of the backend would break so i would need to go back to fix the backend the whole time.
* Building the website in such a way that everything is automated, from automatically creating user profiles and displaying only their own properties. The browse page had to show all the properties that where added.

## Future Implementations

* Allow Users to view other user Profiles
* Allow functionality that will show whether the property was sold or not.
